# heart_disease_prediction
#### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
###### The major challenge in heart disease is its detection.Early detection of cardiac disease can decrease the mortality rate & overallcomplications. However, it is not possible to monitor patients every day in all cases accurately we can use various machine learning algorithms like ANN, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression to analyze the data for hidden patterns. The hidden patterns can beused for health diagnosis in medicinal data.

#### OBJECTIVE:
###### 1.To develop machine learning model to predict future possibility of heart disease byimplementing Logistic Regression. 
###### 2. To determine significant risk factors based on medical dataset which may lead to heartdisease. 
###### 3.To analyze feature selection methods and understand their working principle

#### WORKFLOW:
##### Data Pre-processing step: 
###### In this step, we will pre-process the data so that we can use it in our code efficiently.
##### Fitting Logistic Regression to the Training set:
###### Now we will train the dataset using the training set. For providing training or fitting the model to the training set, we will  import the LogisticRegression class of the sklearn library. After importing the class, we will create a classifier object and use it to fit the model to the logistic regression.
##### Predicting the Test Result:
###### Our model is well trained on the training set, so we will now predict the result by using test set data.
##### Test Accuracy of the result:
###### Now, we have to feed the test data in to the ML model to predict the accuracy.
##### Visualizing the training set result:
###### By using the Test data we will be able to see the result by the help of Training data.

#### CONCLUSION:
###### In this project our Machine Learning model can predict whether the person is affected by  heart disease or not, and it will also provide the accuracy rate of the prediction around 80% which is high accuracy rate, it indicates that our model is efficient for predicting the heart disease. It is important to detect heart disease early in order to provide medication to the users and able to diagnose easily.
